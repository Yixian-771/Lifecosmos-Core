The Characteristics of Lifechanyuan

Xuefeng

Lifechanyuan belongs to the universe and to nature itself.
It does not belong to any nation, political party, religion, organization, or individual—not even to Earth.

The core purpose of Lifechanyuan is to serve the Thousand-Year World, the Ten-Thousand-Year World, and the Elysium World and its Celestial Island continent.
It does not exist to serve human beings.

Lifechanyuan aims to upgrade human production and life programs from the traditional Civilization 2.0 model to Civilization 3.0.
Its primary objective is to “harvest mature crops” from humanity—that is, to guide those who have undergone inner purification and reached spiritual maturity into the higher realms—while preventing the repeated destruction of human civilization.

Therefore, Lifechanyuan is not an enemy of any specific nation, political party, religion, organization, or individual.

Lifechanyuan will never serve any nation, political party, religion, organization, or individual, nor will it cater to the desires, demands, or viewpoints of any such entity.

No matter what difficulties, blows, or trials it encounters, Lifechanyuan will never lower its standards and will never submit to or surrender to Civilization 2.0.

Human intelligence and spiritual capacity are insufficient to fully comprehend Lifechanyuan.
For this reason, Lifechanyuan does not expect to be understood.
It walks alone.
It does not cooperate with any nation, political party, religion, organization, or individual.
It does not seek assistance or support from any of them, nor does it seek attention or favor from experts, scholars, celebrities, high officials, or the wealthy.

Those who believe Lifechanyuan is right may walk with Lifechanyuan.
Those who believe they themselves are right should walk their own path.

Do not instruct Lifechanyuan.
Do not make demands of Lifechanyuan.
Do not attempt to act “for the good of” Lifechanyuan.

Do not judge or criticize Lifechanyuan using the viewpoints of any historical figures, scholars, or masters other than Jesus Christ, Buddha Shakyamuni, and Laozi.
Lifechanyuan does not engage in discussion, argument, or debate.

It would rather face destruction than compromise.

This is the nature of Lifechanyuan.
